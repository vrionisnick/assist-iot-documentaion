Introduction
***************
The main functionality of this enabler will be to register: (i) a smart IoT device in a deployment, and (ii) a cluster in an ASSIST-IoT deployment, including in the latter case all the necessary messages to notify it to the smart orchestrator. It will also execute all the required actions related to networking for enabling connectivity among isolated/independent clusters, including those that have been added via VPN/SD-WAN technology.  Besides, It will allow monitoring any registered node and device in the deployment, including its status (i.e., available and used resources) and current instantiated enablersâ€™ components.
