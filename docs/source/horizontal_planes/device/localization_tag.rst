Introduction

The ASSIST-IoT localisation tag is a Smart IoT device used for indoor people localisation. This device has tag functionality, and it contains a buzzer and red LED. The buzzer is used to indicate to the person that he/she is in a restricted area. The button is used to alert the system when the worker detects an accident and immediate help is needed.

User guide
**********
The battery of the tag has to be charged during non-working hours.
The monitored assets needs to have a tag attached (e.g., in case of a worker, he/she has to wear a belt or helmet with it).
Information about the correspondence between tag and asset must be noted, so they can be later on related. In case of a worker, information about whether it is connected to a belt or helmet should be noted as well.
